# Tutorial-1 - Basics

This package contains a simple Go program, `main.go`, which is explained below:

## main.go

The `main.go` file is a simple Go program that prints "Radhe Radhe" to the standard output.

Here's a breakdown of the [code](main.go):

- `package main`: This line defines the package name of this Go program. Every Go program starts running in a package called `main`.

- `import "fmt"`: This line imports the built-in `fmt` package in Go which provides functions for formatted I/O.

- `func main()`: The `main()` function is the entry point of our program. The Go runtime calls this function when the program starts, and where the program execution begins.

- `fmt.Println("Radhe Radhe")`: This line calls the `Println` function from the `fmt` package to print the string "Radhe Radhe" to the standard output.

- This program, when run, will simply print "Radhe Radhe" to your console.
